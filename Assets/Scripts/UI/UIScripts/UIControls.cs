    //The goal here is to streamline our control scheme onto a simple set of onscreen buttons.  This will
    //both make it possible for mobile without a keyboard, and will help channel our creativity when it comes
    //to interactions the player has available to them.  One problem that occurs as we look at the design, is 
    //that we want our 9 button interface to be available throughout the stack.  While there is probably a clever way

    // Start is called before the first frame update

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
